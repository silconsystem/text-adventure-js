Text Adventure based on OkayBenjis engine

- added a dicegame combat
- added graphics and inventory display
- added a chatGPT script to get a complete story 
- added an array of strings for random responses when fighting

TODO !

optimize game logic with re-usable functions.

initGame.js and scratchpad.txt are functions I am testing and are not used in the game logic
